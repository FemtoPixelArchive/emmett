	<h3>Jay</h3>
	<p>Jay is the mystery from this band ... Plays left-handed, writes right-handed, he's bass player for EMMETT and lead-vocalist for AANOD (a metalcore band); Always trying to look bad, but as soft as a plush! A real breakdown with a cute pop/rock band like EMMETT!</p>
	<p>He got many projects all as different from the others like building sites (like this site), multiple musical projects, building an arcade cabinet and so on...</p>
	<p>He's always saying the same things on each website : "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this: ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A". Only geeks understands...</p>
