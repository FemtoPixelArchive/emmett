msgid "Roméo began percussions at the Conservatory when he was 8. He stayed there for 7 years, until his desire to rock and roll took over. It will then form a first band where he'll hold the position of singer-drummer, then a second and even a third before joining EMMETT as drummer. This will be a breakthrough for him as it is with this band that he will make his first gig, a first at La Scène Bastille and then at La Cigale! That is what we call a Usain Bolt start!"
